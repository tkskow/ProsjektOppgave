\label{chp:dns_tunneling}



\Gls{dns} tunneling was first used by people who exploited that \Gls{dns} was not monitored in network you had to pay to use, e.g. hotels and caf√©s. It was used as an \Gls{vpn} tunnel. In later years it has been discovered that in enterprises the \Gls{dns} are not monitored as much as other traffic on the network. People has therefore figured out that it is a good way to ex filtrate data in secure networks. \Gls{dns} could also be used for a "command and control" attack, where commands are sent over \Gls{dns}.

The way \Gls{dns} works it that if you control the authoritative \Gls{dns} server for a domain you can easily send commands. 


With the increase of smartphones it has been discovered that \Gls{dns} tunneling could again be used as the it started, to use the network without having to pay for it. Carriers can not start charging for regular queries since just regular use of a the internet produces a lot of \Gls{dns} traffic. Which an user would not see and it would be hard for the carrier to explain for an user what he has been charged for.
